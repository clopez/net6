16: Error code transmission
---------------------------
We should transmit error codes instead of error strings in net6. The client 
may build a (localised, see #14) string out of it.

14: Translate failure messages with gettext
-------------------------------------------
The failure messages issued by net6 should be localised and translated with 
gettext. Error code transmission (#16) should be implemented first so that 
the client gets the message in his own locale and not in the one of the 
server.
