46: Fix the permissions when building a release tarball
-------------------------------------------------------
''darcs'' messes with the permissions when one checks out a working copy 
from the repository as it does not preserve them at all. We should try to 
regain the correct executable bits on the files before building a tarball 
which gets distributed to other parties. Mostly it should not be a problem 
but some might depend on calling a script directly without prefixing it 
with ''/bin/sh''. This affects all components, but it is filed against net6 
as this should be the next thing to be released.

47: The path containing the pkg-config specs should be determined
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The path which receives our pkg-config spec files is currently hardcoded as 
it was advised on the web. On FreeBSD it should not go into 
''$(prefix)/libdata/pkgconfig'' instead of ''$(libdir)/pkgconfig''. 
Autoconf does not even support a ''--libdata=DIR'' configuration option, 
and I do not yet know any program which uses this. As Darwin also lacks a 
''libdata'' subdirectory this probably needs just a special conditional for 
FreeBSD. More input on this is certainly needed. This affects both ''net6'' 
and ''libobby''.

14: net6: Localisation
----------------------
The failure messages issued by net6 should be localised and translated with 
gettext. Error code transmission (#16) should be implemented first so that 
the client gets the message in his own locale and not in the one of the 
server.
