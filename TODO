47: The path containing the pkg-config specs should be determined
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The path which receives our pkg-config spec files is currently hardcoded as 
it was advised on the web. On FreeBSD it should not go into 
''$(prefix)/libdata/pkgconfig'' instead of ''$(libdir)/pkgconfig''. 
Autoconf does not even support a ''--libdata=DIR'' configuration option, 
and I do not yet know any program which uses this. As Darwin also lacks a 
''libdata'' subdirectory this probably needs just a special conditional for 
FreeBSD. More input on this is certainly needed. This affects both ''net6'' 
and ''libobby''.
