net6
====

This file lists prioritised items which need to be fixed or developed.

Serious:

Important:
 * Catch connection resets (might depend on ``Add error codes'').

Normal:
 * Add error codes.
 * Provide on_*-Methods for signals being emitted to allow derived classes
   to overwrite these methods to do things before/after signals have been
   emitted (server/client/host)
 * host::shutdown will not work correctly since the self object will be
   destroyed as well and no longer be in the peer list after a reopen()
 * Use a login_extend-like interface for net6::client as well
   (replacing the custom_login API)

Minor:

Wishlist:
 * Translate failure messages with gettext.
