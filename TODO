109: Encryption support
-----------------------
net6 should support transport level security through a symmetric block 
cipher like AES with a key provided by the client to protect the data 
stream which is currently in plain-text.

110: Encryption
---------------
Support encryption in the net6 network layer, possibly through GNU TLS or 
through an own implementation.
